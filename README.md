# Denoising-RPCA

Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) is a modification of the widely used statistical procedure of principal component analysis (PCA) which works well with respect to grossly corrupted observations.
In this project, which was done under the guidance of Dr. Sowmya, we have demonstrated the effect of outliers in data in PCA and proved the effectiveness of RPCA. 
Then the method was used to reconstruct patched and noised faces from the Yale B database which contains 2414 frontal-face images demonstrating data-driven reconstruction technique of RPCA.
